# my-utils

A set of scripts that I use frequently. Written in a mix of shell (some POSIX
sh, some bash), sed, awk, and so on. Any dependencies *beyond* the POSIX
standard and inter-dependency are noted.

*All* scripts support `-h` and `--help` for printing built-in documentation.

*Almost all* scripts do nothing if no input arguments are given.


## Development

These scripts are an unusual collection. Some I wrote from scratch, others are
owed to the unknown authors that posted their scripts to the /usr/local/bin
folder on a multi-user system.

There's been a great deal of feature creep, bikeshedding, and over-engineering.

Everything is always in alpha-mode. With that said, you can rely on `SCRIPT -v`
to ensure that there hasn't been a breaking change.


## License

Go ahead.

I'm licensing everything under GPL because I'd appreciate you letting me know I
messed something up. But I'm not going to call the license police on you.
